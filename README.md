# Handwriting_Recognition
This project is a deep learning-based handwriting recognition system that classifies handwritten digits or characters from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built using TensorFlow/Keras, the system can be extended for real-time use in applications such as OCR, document digitization, and educational tools.
